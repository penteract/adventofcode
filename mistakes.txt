day 1
Failing to realise quickly that the autotester had downloaded the wrong tests

day 2
Not including "import sys" in my starting code

day 3
being insufficiently familiar with python (s1.intersection(s2) == s1&s2)

day 4
not turning strings into integers (wrong answer)

day 5
forgetting about stripping space from input lines,
failing to realise the code had succeeded and it was now testing against part 2


day 9
iterating 8 times rather than 9

day 12
failing to realise the code had succeeded and it was now testing against part 2 (again)
I incorrectly resubmitted the part 1 answer to part 2,
 then thought I'd misread the question and solved part 2 before realising it was part 2

day 13
insufficient familiarity with python - sorted does not take a comparator function
  (functools.cmp_to_key works)
  'index', not find or search

day 15
inspecting the input by hand to check whether there were any beacons with y==2000000 (wrong submission)
convoluted range-intersection code

day 16
didn't optimise soon enough (part 2)
should probably have used bitsets?

day 17
spending too long checking things in part 2 rather than just going for it

day 19
misreading the question (got stuck until joe helped me)

day 20
Not thinking carefully enough about precise behaviour

day 21
insufficient familiarity with sympy/spending too long trying to remember it
