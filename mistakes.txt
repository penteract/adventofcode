Day 1
Server was overloaded; could have set up something to automate submitting. Didn't matter since the day is unscored and I'm happy not to be bombarding the server with requests when it's down.

Day 2
Used c[r+1] rather than c[r-1] to work with the fact that r used 1-based indexing.(wrong submission)
Then added code to check that the values were in bounds.(ws)
Then forgot to remove the broken code to check that the values were in bounds(ws)
Then somehow had changed one == to != but not the other.(ws)

Day 3
Wasn't perfectly ready on time (tried to do a 2017 one as warmup).
Didn't read the question fully (missed the repeat horizontally bit.
Got dx and dy mixed up

Day 4
Used d rather than p (I needed a dictionary). Took a while to spot the mistake because I've assigned to d unnecessarily so that I have a defaultdict handy
wrote ecl rather than hcl

Day 5

Day 6
Input and problem statement took 2 minutes to load
misreading the question
ignoring the last group
(part 2) set.intersection does not mutate
