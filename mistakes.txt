Day 1
Server was overloaded; could have set up something to automate submitting. Didn't matter since the day is unscored and I'm happy not to be bombarding the server with requests when it's down.

Day 2
Used c[r+1] rather than c[r-1] to work with the fact that r used 1-based indexing.
Then added code to check that the values were in bounds.
Then forgot to remove the broken code to check that the values were in bounds
Then somehow had changed one == to != but not the other.
