Day 1:
off by one error - counting the first value as an increase (wrong submission)

Day 2:
My IDE was suspended at the start of the contest.

Day 5:
part 1
range(a,b+1) is not all integers from a to b if b<a (ws)
part 2
y-y2-2*y does not equal y2-y (ws)
forget to include the end of a range (ws)

Day 8:
Implementing a solution that was harder than necessary (both parts)

Day 9:
forgetting to remove an else clause from a loop after a break

Day 11:
misreading that an octupus flashes at above 9 as at 9 or above

Day 12:
not reading "single" in "you might have time to visit a single small cave twice"
not reading "the caves named start and end can only be visited exactly once each"
  realising I didn't allow visiting end twice and adding some code to allow it
taking too long to start writing a solution

Day 13:
folding downwards rather than upwards
hardcoding terrible (large and based on incorrect output) constants for printing then making my terminal >1000 characters wide to see the output

day 14:
using 1 rather than the value in the dictionary (in 2 different places)
