Day 1
not changing int(a+b) (should be 10*a+b) when a and b changed from strings to ints in part 2 (wrong submission)

Day 4
Off by one errors (that I'd anticipated, but didn't hold in mind for long enough)

Day 5
bug in interval intersection arithmetic (wrong submission), mistake was not quickly deciding to reread bug-prone code

Day 6
(part 2) Assuming the input was big enough that a naive solution wouldn't work; needing to look up the quadratic formula

Day 7
Not reading the problem carefully enough (wrong submission) ; off-by-one index error (wrong submission)

Day 8
messing around with input handling functions ; (part 2) off by 1 errors (wrong submission)
