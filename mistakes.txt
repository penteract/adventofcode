Day 1
Not removing the old automatically downloaded files

Day 3
Not realising part 1 had already been submitted successfully; Failing to get sample input quickly for part 2.

Day 4:
trying to break out of too many nested loops (part 2).
  Lesson: use `else: break` for alternating quantifiers `else: continue; break` for non-alternating quantifiers.

Day 5:
Being distracted and not starting on time (30s)

Day 7:
getting variable names wrong, bad variable naming

Day 8:
getting order for scalar multiplication of Pt the wrong way round
Not knowing itertools.combinations off the top of my head

Day 9:
part 2:
  getting if branches the wrong way round
  incorrect optimisation (wrong submission)

Day 11:
(part2) Pasting the wrong bit of output because the autotester didn't work (ws)

Day 12:
Being a bit too tired; a bunch of minor bugs
(part 2) putting a line of code in the wrong branch of a conditional.


Day 13:
(part 2 (?)) `for a,b,p,_ in zip(flns[0::4],flns[1::4],flns[2::4],flns[3::4])` misses the last group since there isn't a final blank line (ws*2)
(part 2) using sympy to solve part of the problem when it could have solved the whole problem (ws*2)
not counting the number of digits when deciding if an answer wasn't too low (ws)

Day 14:
(part 2) forgetting to change 100 to i
(part 2) prgrid in u.py doesn't work with my current method of defining grids
(part 2) utils/crt.py doesn't actually contain an easy to use crt(Chinese Remainder Theorem) function (naiveMinCRT would have worked)
