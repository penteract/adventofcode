Day 1:
off by one error - counting the first value as an increase (wrong submission)

Day 2:
My IDE was suspended at the start of the contest.

Day 5:
part 1
range(a,b+1) is not all integers from a to b if b<a (ws)
part 2
y-y2-2*y does not equal y2-y (ws)
forget to include the end of a range (ws)

Day 8:
Implementing a solution that was harder than necessary (both parts)

Day 9:
forgetting to remove an else clause from a loop after a break
