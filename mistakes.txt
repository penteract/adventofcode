day 1
Failing to realise quickly that the autotester had downloaded the wrong tests

day 2
Not including "import sys" in my starting code

day 3
being insufficiently familiar with python (s1.intersection(s2) == s1&s2)

day 4
not turning strings into integers (wrong answer)

day 5
forgetting about stripping space from input lines,
failing to realise the code had succeeded and it was now testing against part 2
