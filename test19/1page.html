Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<style>article *[title]{border-bottom:1px dotted #ffff66;}</style><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation ---</h2><p>Santa has become stranded at the edge of the Solar System while delivering presents to other planets! To accurately calculate his position in space, safely align his warp drive, and return to Earth in time to save Christmas, he needs you to bring him <span title="If only you had time to grab an astrolabe.">measurements</span> from <em class="star">fifty stars</em>.</p>
<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em class="star">one star</em>. Good luck!</p>
<p>The Elves quickly load you into a spacecraft and prepare to launch.</p>
<p>At the first Go / No Go poll, every Elf is Go until the Fuel Counter-Upper.  They haven't determined the amount of fuel required yet.</p>
<p>Fuel required to launch a given <em>module</em> is based on its <em>mass</em>.  Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a mass of <code>12</code>, divide by 3 and round down to get <code>4</code>, then subtract 2 to get <code>2</code>.</li>
<li>For a mass of <code>14</code>, dividing by 3 and rounding down still yields <code>4</code>, so the fuel required is also <code>2</code>.</li>
<li>For a mass of <code>1969</code>, the fuel required is <code>654</code>.</li>
<li>For a mass of <code>100756</code>, the fuel required is <code>33583</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Fuel Counter-Upper needs to know the total fuel requirement.  To find it, individually calculate the fuel needed for the mass of each module (your puzzle input), then add together all the fuel values.</p>
<p><em>What is the sum of the fuel requirements</em> for all of the modules on your spacecraft?</p>
